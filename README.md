# self_organizing_map
A self organizing map in python. Made for Siraj Raval's Coding Challenge. 

## Image Folders
There are several folders in the repository that start with the prefix `image_`. These contain video forms of network after each iteration (I have not added the images because they are huge) The folders are named with the following form: 

'image_datatype_decayradius_decaylr'


## Weights

The weights are stored as numpy files. Their naming convention is the same as the images, but with the 'weight_' prefix
